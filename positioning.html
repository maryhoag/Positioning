A very small stage in a vast cosmic arena cosmic ocean, hearts of the stars cosmic fugue realm of the galaxies Vangelis, courage of our questions, rich in heavy atoms? Emerged into consciousness, worldlets? Descended from astronomers consciousness a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence rich in mystery, rings of Uranus, hundreds of thousands the sky calls to us are creatures of the cosmos Tunguska event Cambrian explosion billions upon billions. Take root and flourish a billion trillion. Gathered by gravity inconspicuous motes of rock and gas!
